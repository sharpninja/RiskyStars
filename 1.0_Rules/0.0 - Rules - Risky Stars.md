# Rules - Risky Stars

## Body Types and Resources

- Each Body provides one specific resource type (Population, Metals, Fuel).
- Planets are grouped by Gas Giants and Rocky.  Planetoids are Rocky.  Comets are Frozen Liquid.
	- Gas Giants: Fuel
	- Rocky Panet: Population
	- Planetoid: Metals
	- Comet: Fuel

## Resource Production

- Each Region of a Body produces a base rate of one hundred (100) units of that Body's resource per turn.

## Body Upgrades

- Each Body can be upgraded from resources.  Upgrades are removed when a Body changes ownership.
- Body upgrades require the two resources not produced on the Body.
- Upgrades have 3 levels
	- Level 1: 10% Yield Improvement (110 units per turn)
		- Cost: 500 Units of each Resource.
	- Level 2: 50% Yield Improvement (150 units per turn)
		- Cost: 2500 Units of each Resource.
	- Level 3: 100% Yield Improvement (200 units per turn)
		- Cost: 5000 Units of each Resource.

## Heroes

- Heroes are assigned to Bodies where they either provide a fixed resource per turn or apply a modifier to the total Yield of the Body's output.
- Heroes have three classifications:
	- Class I: Provide Fixed Resource
	- Class II: Apply 25% Yield Improvement
	- Class III: Apply 25% Yield Improvement, then Provide Fixed Resource
- Bodies may have up to three (3) Heroes at any one time, but no more than the number of Regions for the Body.
- Heroes are removed from the game if they are assigned to a Body that is captured by another player.

## Regions

- Gas Giants, Comets and Planetoids only have one region each.
- Rocky Planets are grouped by surface type:
	- Barren (No flowing water) - Two (2) regions, Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
	- Gaia (Mixed Continents and Oceans) - One (1) region per continent. Two (2) to Ten (10) Continents per planet.
	- Ocean (No Continents) - One (1) region per planet.

## Alliances

- Allied Players pool resources to calculate new armies per turn for the alliance.  Armies are allocated based on each member's total controlled regions.
- Allied Players cannot attack one-another.
- A player can leave an Alliance at any time but cannot attack remaining Alliance members for three turns following the turn they leave the Alliance.  Likewise, an Alliance cannot attack a player that has left the Alliance for three turns following the turn that the player left the Alliance.

## Players

- Each Player begins in a Home Star System on a Gaia type Rocky Planet.  
- The total number of regions is the same for all Home Star Systems

## Maps

- Each Map has 2 to 6 Home Star Systems.
- Each Map has a Featured Star System with two times (2x) the number of Regions as found in a Home Star System.
- Each Map has 2 Minor Star Systems for each Home Star System that has one quarter (25%) the number of regions of a Home Star System.
	- Minor Star Systems have two hyperspace lanes leading to it, each from a Home Star System.

## Navigating

- A player may move one (1) whole army or a part of an existing army one (1) time per turn.
- A player may move an army to any Region in the same star system.
- A player may move an army to the mouth of a Hyperspace Lane.
- A player may move an army located at the mouth of a Hyperspace Lane to the opposite end of the Hyperspace Lane where it will end the turn at the mouth of the Hyperspace Lane in the distant Star System.
- When an army leaves a location:
	- If the Current Player is in Possession of the location the player ___must___ leave at least one (1) unit behind to maintain possession.  Locations cannot be abandoned.
	- If the Current Player is not in Possession of the location (ex. Location is Possessed by an Ally), the entire army must leave together. 
- When an army arrives at a location:
	- If an Army of the same Player is present, the armies are combined and become one army.
	- If an Army of an Allied Player is present, both Armies maintain a neutral posture and stay separate.
	- If an Army of a non-Allied Player is present, combat is immediately initiated.
	- If an Army of a non-Allied Player is present and is in combat with an army of the current Player or the current Player's Alliance, the arriving army joins the combat as reinforcements.
	- If an Army of a non-Allied Player is present and is in combat with an army of another non-Allied Player, the Current Player's Army returns to its launch point and its turn is consumed.
	- If no army is present, then the Current Player gains possession of the Region or Hyperspace Mouth and must automatically defend it if an opposing player's army arrives.
- Any time an army arrives at a location but does not take possession of the location and a non-Allied Player maintains possession of the Location, then the Current Player's army returns to its Launch Location and its turn is consumed.
